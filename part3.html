        </h1>
        Newton formulated the laws of motion in his book "Principia". Newton’s laws of motion relate an object’s
        motion to the forces acting on it. In the first law, an object will not change its motion unless a force acts on
        it. In the second law,
        the force on an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration.
        In the third law, when two objects interact, they apply forces to each other of equal magnitude and opposite
        direction. <br><br>
        Newton’s laws of motion are important because they are the foundation of classical mechanics, one of the main
        branches
        of physics. Mechanics is the study of how objects move or do not move when forces act upon them.<br><br><br><br>
