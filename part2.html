            Motion</h1>
        Legend has it that Isaac Newton formulated gravitational theory in 1665 or 1666 after watching an apple fall and
        asking why
        the apple fell straight down, rather than sideways or even upward.Newton realized that some force must be acting
        on falling
        objects like apples because otherwise they would not start moving from rest. Newton called this force "gravity"
        and determined
        that gravitational forces exist between all objects.<br><br>
        Gravity is a force of attraction that exists between any two objects. There is a force of
        gravity between the sun and the Earth, between the Earth and us, and even between two marbles. Gravity is the
        weakest of the four
        known forces of nature, yet the most dominant force.
        Even though it's the weakest force, Gravity holds together entire solar systems and galaxies!
        The law of universal gravitation says that every object attracts every other object with a force that,
        for any two objects, is directly proportional to the mass of each object and
        inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two objects.<br><br>
